  <h2>Mesothelioma Overview</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    Mesothelioma is a highly aggressive and lethal cancer that develops in the
    mesothelium, a thin tissue layer covering most of our internal organs. While
    treatments exist, a full cure is often elusive for many mesothelioma
    patients.
  </p>
  <h2>Types of Mesothelioma</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    Medical professionals categorize mesothelioma based on the affected
    mesothelium. The most common type is pleural mesothelioma, which affects the
    tissue surrounding the lungs. Other less common types include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Peritoneal mesothelioma - affects abdominal tissue</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>Pericardial mesothelioma - affects the heart's surrounding tissue</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Mesothelioma of tunica vaginalis - affects the tissue around the
        testicles
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Symptoms of Mesothelioma</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    The symptoms associated with mesothelioma vary depending on the cancer's
    location.
  </p>
  <span>Pleural Mesothelioma</span>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Chest pain</p></li>
    <li><p>Painful coughing</p></li>
    <li><p>Shortness of breath</p></li>
    <li><p>Unusual tissue lumps under the chest skin</p></li>
    <li><p>Unexplained weight loss</p></li>
  </ul>
  <span>Peritoneal Mesothelioma</span>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Abdominal pain</p></li>
    <li><p>Abdominal swelling</p></li>
    <li><p>Nausea</p></li>
    <li><p>Unexplained weight loss</p></li>
  </ul>
  <span>Other Mesotheliomas</span>
  <p>
    The symptoms for other, rarer types of mesothelioma, like pericardial
    mesothelioma and mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis, remain largely
    unclear due to their rarity.
  </p>
  <h2>Causes of Mesothelioma</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    Cancer typically arises from a series of changes or mutations in a cell's
    DNA. These mutations instruct the cell to grow and multiply uncontrollably,
    leading to tumor formation. While the initial triggers for these mutations
    remain unclear in the case of mesothelioma, it's thought that a combination
    of factors like inherited conditions, the environment, health conditions,
    and lifestyle choices play a part.
  </p>
  <h2>Mesothelioma Risk Factors</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    Mesothelioma is primarily linked to asbestos exposure. Asbestos, a natural
    heat-resistant mineral, is widely used in numerous products such as
    insulation materials, brakes, shingles, and flooring due to its strong
    fibers. However, when disturbed, such as during mining or insulation
    removal, asbestos can create dust that, when inhaled or ingested, may settle
    in the lungs or stomach. These embedded fibers can cause irritation leading
    to the development of mesothelioma, although the exact mechanism is still
    unclear. The latency period between exposure and disease manifestation can
    range from 20 to 60 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    While many individuals exposed to asbestos never develop mesothelioma, it
    suggests the involvement of other factors in determining susceptibility to
    the disease. It may be the case that certain people have inherited a genetic
    predisposition to cancer, or there may be other conditions that augment
    their risk.
  </p>
  <p>Several factors can escalate the risk of mesothelioma:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Prior asbestos exposure:</b> Individuals who've been directly exposed
      to asbestos fibers at their workplace or home have a substantially
      heightened risk of developing mesothelioma.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Residential proximity to an asbestos worker:</b> Asbestos workers may
      bring home the mineral's fibers on their skin or clothing, potentially
      exposing household members to the mineral over prolonged periods. This
      indirect exposure can also increase the risk of developing mesothelioma.
      However, the risk can be mitigated by adopting preventive measures, like
      showering and changing clothes before leaving the workplace.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Family history of mesothelioma:</b> Those with a close relative, such
      as a parent, sibling, or child diagnosed with mesothelioma, may face an
      elevated risk of the disease.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Prior chest radiation therapy:</b> Those who underwent radiation
      therapy for chest cancer may also have an increased likelihood of
      developing mesothelioma.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Complications</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    As pleural mesothelioma progresses, it applies pressure on the chest area's
    structures, leading to complications like difficulty breathing, chest pain,
    trouble swallowing, nerve and spinal cord pressure, and fluid accumulation
    in the chest.
  </p>
  <h2>Prevention</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>Lowering your asbestos exposure can reduce your mesothelioma risk. Here are some preventive measures:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Be aware if your work involves asbestos exposure.</p></li>
    <li><p>Follow all workplace safety regulations.</p></li>
    <li><p>Implement safe practices around asbestos in your home. Do not attempt to remove asbestos on your own; instead, hire a qualified expert.</p></li>
  </ul>

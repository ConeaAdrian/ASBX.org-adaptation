  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    The Owens Corning Fibreboard Asbestos Personal Injury Trust is a notable
    case of a legal arbitration system. This Trust was put in place on October
    31, 2006, and stems from the bankruptcy of two leading companies, Owens
    Corning and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fibreboard.
  </p>
  <span>Origins of the Trust</span>
  <p>
    Both companies, Owens Corning and Fibreboard, faced bankruptcy, which led to
    the foundation of the Owens Corning Fibreboard Asbestos Personal Injury
    Trust. This Trust was to address all asbestos-related lawsuits that both
    businesses were legally responsible for.
  </p>
  <span>Purpose of the Trust</span>
  <p>
    The Trust was primarily established to resolve all existing asbestos-related
    legal disputes associated with Owens Corning, Fibreboard, and any other
    relevant protected parties.
  </p>
  <span>Start of Claim Acceptance</span>
  <p>
    The Trust initiated the acceptance of claims related to Owens Corning
    Fibreboard Asbestos Personal Injury on August 27, 2007, starting precisely
    at 10:00 AM EST.

    Distribution Procedures (TDP).
  </p>

    claims.

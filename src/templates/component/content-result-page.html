    <p>Recovered by Flint Cooper in asbestos-related litigation</p>
    <p>
      TAILORING OUR LEGAL SERVICES TO FIT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF EACH CLIENT,
      NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flint Cooper’s mission is to achieve justice for victims harmed at the
      hands of the government, companies and organizations, and empower those
      whose life, livelihood or lifeblood have been destroyed by injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      With over 20 years of experience in filing asbestos-related lawsuits and
      asbestos trust funds claims for victims, Flint Cooper is a top national
      asbestos law firm with a solid track record of securing over two billion
      dollars for thousands of clients.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        Flint Cooper wins trials, not just collects settlements. Over the years,
        asbestos defendants have settled because they know Flint Cooper can
        prove they exposed generations of workers, veterans and family members
        to cancer-causing illnesses. Flint Cooper prepares arduously and is
        willing to take claims to trial, which is primarily the reason most
        defendants settle sooner: to sidestep the uncertainty of a jury’s
        verdict, to dodge embarrassment in the media, to spare themselves
        greater financial loss, and most importantly, to avoid facing Flint
        Cooper asbestos attorneys in court.

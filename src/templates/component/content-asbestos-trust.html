  <h2>Introduction to Mesothelioma Trust Funds</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    When discussing asbestos-related health issues, the term' mesothelioma trust
    funds' frequently emerges. These financial reserves, developed during
    bankruptcy procedures by companies that acted negligently, are designed as
    compensation. With over $30 billion earmarked in over 62 trusts,
    understanding these funds is crucial for victims and their families.
  </p>
  <h2>Historical Roots of Asbestos Trust Funds</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    Asbestos, a mineral once praised for its resistance to heat and durability,
    saw prolific use until the late 1980s. However, its fatal health
    implications became evident, reducing its use. Remarkably, many companies
    persisted in its utilization despite comprehending these risks. This
    negligence culminated in numerous claims, prompting the U.S. Congress to
    authorize the inception of trust funds in 1994 to ensure compensation.
  </p>
  <h2>Different Bankruptcy Types for Asbestos Companies</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    Companies confronted with overwhelming asbestos-related claims found
    themselves cornered financially. They had two ways to handle this:
  </p>
  <ul class="mark-text">
    <li>
      <b>Chapter 7 (Liquidation):</b> Companies had to liquidate their assets.
      Proceeds from these assets would then be funneled to victims as
      compensation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Chapter 11 (Reorganization):</b> This option permitted companies to
      undergo a structural makeover, preserving their business while dedicating
      funds to victims.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Detailed Trust Fund Eligibility Criteria</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>

      victim's family, also have a set deadline for filing.

  <h1>Asbestos Exposure and Cancer Risk</h1>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    Asbestos, a group of naturally occurring minerals known for their resistance
    to heat, fire, and chemicals, is widely used in various industries. However,
    it poses significant health risks, such as mesothelioma, lung cancer, and
    other diseases. This article provides insights into asbestos, its uses, and
    the associated health hazards of exposure.

  <h2>Asbestos Overview</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <img class="video" src="../../img/Rectangle 895.png" alt="" />
  <p>
    Asbestos refers to a group of six naturally-occurring minerals. They are
    divided into two main groups:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Serpentine asbestos, which includes chrysotile, has long, curly fibers
        used extensively in commerce.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Amphibole asbestos, including minerals like actinolite, tremolite,
        anthophyllite, crocidolite, and amosite, has straight, brittle fibers
        and limited fabrication capabilities.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Apart from these, asbestos-like minerals like erionite are also present in
    nature.
  </p>

  <h2>Commercial Use of Asbestos</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <span>Historical Context</span>
  <p>
    Asbestos use began to surge during World War II. From insulation in the
    construction industry to fireproofing materials and strengthening plastics,
    asbestos found broad applications across industries. It even found its way
    into consumer goods, like certain garden products and crayons.
  </p>
  <span>Current Regulations</span>
  <p>
    Since the late 1970s, asbestos use has faced restrictions due to its
    potential health risks. Regulations were established to minimize asbestos
    exposure, from banning certain applications to enforcing regular inspections
    for its presence in buildings. Efforts to mitigate asbestos risks have
    significantly reduced its usage in the U.S.
  </p>

  <h2>Health Impacts of Asbestos Exposure</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    Long-term asbestos exposure can lead to serious health issues. When tiny
    asbestos fibers are disturbed, they can be breathed in and get stuck in the
    lungs. This can lead to scarring and inflammation over a prolonged period.
    Various health and environmental organizations classify asbestos as a human
    carcinogen and link it to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Mesothelioma is a rare cancer affecting the chest and abdomen lining.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Lung, larynx, and ovary cancers.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Possible increase in the risk of stomach, pharynx, and colorectal
        cancers.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In addition to cancer, asbestos exposure can result in non-cancerous
    diseases like asbestosis, inflammatory lung disease, and pleural disorders.
  </p>

  <h2>At-risk Populations for Asbestos-related Diseases</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Regular asbestos contact, primarily in work environments, significantly
        increases the disease risk.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Certain professions, including asbestos mining, construction,
        shipbuilding, and other asbestos-related trades, carry higher exposure
        risks.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Emergency personnel involved in significant events, like the September
        11 attacks, are also at risk due to potential asbestos release into the
        air.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Even brief exposures can result in asbestos-related diseases, which
        might not manifest until decades after the initial exposure.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Key Factors Influencing Asbestos Exposure Risks</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>Several factors can escalate the risk of mesothelioma:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The extent and duration of asbestos exposure</p></li>
    <li><p>Physical properties of the asbestos fibers</p></li>
    <li><p>Source of exposure</p></li>
    <li><p>Individual factors like smoking and existing lung diseases</p></li>
    <li><p>Genetic mutations like BAP1</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Smoking and Asbestos Exposure</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    Asbestos exposure coupled with smoking can heighten the chances of
    developing lung cancer. However, there's no evidence linking smoking to an
    increased risk of mesothelioma. Asbestos-exposed individuals, regardless of
    exposure level, are strongly advised against smoking.
  </p>

  <h2>Detection of Asbestos-related Diseases</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    Individuals who may have been exposed to asbestos should seek medical advice
    promptly, especially if they experience symptoms such as persistent cough,
    shortness of breath, chest pain, difficulty swallowing, and weight loss.
    Various diagnostic tools like chest X-rays, lung biopsies, and
    bronchoscopies can help detect asbestos-related diseases. However, these
    tests can't quantify the extent of asbestos exposure or predict disease
    onset.

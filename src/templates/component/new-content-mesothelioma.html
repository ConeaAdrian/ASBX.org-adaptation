  <h2>What is Mesothelioma?</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    The United States Gypsum Asbestos Personal Injury Settlement Trust, formed
    under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, is designed to resolve all
    asbestos-related claims against the United States Gypsum Company (USG) for
    which the company is legally responsible.
  </p>
  <h2>Causes</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    The primary cause of this type of cancer is asbestos exposure, a group of
    minerals once commonly used in all industries nationwide.
  </p>
  <h2>Symptoms</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    The symptoms of mesothelioma vary depending on the cancer type and location.
    The most common symptoms of pleural mesothelioma, which is the most
    prevalent type, include:

    <li>Constipation</li>

    <li>Pericardial effusion (fluid buildup around the heart)</li>
    <li>Hydrocele (fluid buildup around the testicles)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    The diagnosis of mesothelioma is made through a combination of tests,
    including:
  </p>
  <ul class="mark-text">
    <li>Chest X-ray</li>
    <li>CT scan</li>
    <li>MRI scan</li>
    <li>PET scan</li>
    <li>Biopsy</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <p>
    There is no cure for mesothelioma, but treatments are available that can
    help control the cancer and improve the quality of life. Treatment options
    include:
  </p>
  <ul class="mark-text">
    <li>Surgery</li>
    <li>Chemotherapy</li>
    <li>Radiation therapy</li>
    <li>Immunotherapy</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Prognosis and Life Expectancy</h2>
  <div class="bar"></div>
  <div class="life-expectancy-content">
    <p>
      The prognosis for patients with pleural mesothelioma is generally poor,
      with an average survival time of 12 to 21 months. However, some
      individuals may live for many years despite the disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have been exposed to asbestos, it is important to see a doctor
      regularly for screening for mesothelioma. Improving the chances of
      survival is possible through early detection and treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should speak with your doctor for questions or concerns about
      mesothelioma. They can provide the most accurate and reliable information
      about your situation. So don't hesitate to reach out to them for guidance
      and support. Your health and well-being are their top priorities.
